Detect audio events using deep learning techniques.
This repository contains code for training and evaluating models for sound event detection.
It includes data preprocessing, model architectures, and evaluation metrics.
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Run in root folder with `python -m src.module`

Create a `.env` file in the repo root and insert your HF_TOKEN

i.e.
```python
# .env
HF_TOKEN = xxxx
```

### Generating soundscapes
To generate, scaper and soxbindings (from submodule, and install from source) is required. Otherwise, this can be ignored.
